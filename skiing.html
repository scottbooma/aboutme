            Despite growing up in the North, it wasn't until I moved to South that I learned to ski. Starting in 2019 with a short lesson and tips 
            from my wife, who has been skiing nearly her whole life, I discovered a brand new passion. With a recently gifted GoPro I have begun 
            filming and editing our ski trips. I am hoping to build up my skills as a skier, videographer, and editor so that I can create a 
            memorable movie from our upcoming family ski trip to Colorado.

                This was the first ever video edit I made using my GoPro. It is made up of footage taken from a ski trip up to our local hill on January 
                8th, 2022. As you can see I still have a lot to learn. The camera was angled slightly too high while I was skiing leading to a great 
                view of the sky, but not much of a view of the terrain I was on. In terms of the footage captured, there is plenty of myself skiing, 
                but not too much of the "b-roll" that makes a video entertaining and shows the viewer more of the day. Because skiing is much much 
                more than just going down the mountain. My editing skills definitely need some work as well. The GoPro Quik app used to edit the 
                footage is fairly basic and doesn't allow for much post-processing which leads to some of the colors not quite popping as much as 
                I would like. I was, however, still able to splice the clips together in an entertaining way while adding some text and music for 
                a little bit extra fun. <br><br> <small> Oh, and I also need to work on my skiing, no more embarassing crashes...</small>
