            <p class="intro">
                In the month of May and year of 2020, when the world seemed to be falling down all around us, my wife and I were set to get married. 
                Due to certain circumstances that will remain un-named, we were forced to push our wedding out a year to May 2021. In the meantime, with all of the money and time 
                we now had available from no longer planning a wedding, we decided to buy a house. With the real estate market as crazy as it is, we 
                decided to buy a home that needed some work in order to stay within our budget, despite never having worked on a house in our lives. 
                The house we bought felt like a portal to the 80's with pink, green, and purple walls. It had different carpet in every room, different wallpaper, and massive 3-tiered drapes to match. 
                We figured the work that we would be doing would mostly consist of replacing the flooring and painting, we were wrong. 
                <br><br>
                The kitchen ended up needing a remodel to function for our needs, more specfically the kitchen island. The cooktop present in the island was nice,
                but the wall mounted oven was not. Being a hair larger than the microwave it was not something we could ever use if we wanted to make 
                something like a Thanksgiving dinner or even a large tray of cookies. That had to go and we needed a full size range. This meant 
                the remodel of the entire kitchen island. This was done primarily by myself with a little bit of electrical assistance from my gracious 
                father-in-law. The process of the remodel is documented in the pictures below.

                    Here, we can see just how the kitchen looked the day we bought the house in all of its glory. The island may look nice, but the 
                    two-tier design left for a less than functional kitchen workspace in what is already a tight area. The height of the island also 
                    meant that it was very difficult to find any stools that would fit if we wanted to use it as a bar style seating area. The oven 
                    can be seen on the left just below the microwave. It is so small it could be mistaken for a second microwave.

                <p>
                    This is where the fun started. Demolition is always a good time (provided you are being safe). We broke apart the old island and 
                    ripped the oven out of the cabinet. Along with that we also ripped out the 3 layers of linoleum flooring. The wiring was next and 
                    for that I had my father-in-law bring his knowledge and skills to the table. The wiring from the oven needed to be re-reouted to 
                    the island for the new range and we had to run new wires into the old oven space for a wine cooler we were installing.

                <p>
                    After a layer of plywood was put down to flatten out the subfloor, it was time to start building the new island. As much as I wish I 
                    could say I did this next part all by myself, that would be a lie. We purchased the cabinets pre-made as making cabinets is an 
                    art in and of itself that I am not confident in. Everything else at this point was done by yours truly. The frame behind the 
                    cabinets was made from reclaimed 2x4s that were previously used in other projects in the house. The plywood attached came from 
                    the old island, it was reused to keep the outlets in a similar spot. The siding which is only partially constructed in this picture 
                    was built out of pre-stained 1x4s that I cut and nailed on myself.

                <img src="images/creativity/island/Kitchen Island1.jpeg" alt="Finished Island">
                <p>
                    Here is the island finished in all of its glory! Once the siding was completed, we painted it a beautiful dark blue that allowed it 
                    to pop against the light floors and walls. The biggest eye-catcher in my opinion though, is the butcher block countertop. The 
                    block itself was purchased from Lowes, I had to cut the space for the range and finish it. After sanding it down as smooth as 
                    velvet I applied 4 coats of tung oil to give it the color and protection it needed. This is not a true butcher block, as in we 
                    will not be preparing food on it. To me that seemed somewhat unsanitary and something that would wear down the top quite quickly.

            <div class="island-steps">
                <img src="images/creativity/island/Kitchen Island2.jpeg" alt="New Range">
                <p>
                    The new range was everything we needed. Plenty of space to cook up top and a large oven that doubles as an air fryer. We chose the 
                    flat style range with the controls on the front in order to keep the island look as clean as possible. You can see that we finished 
                    the cabinets with modern gold pulls, this matched with the mid-century aesthetic we were going with for the rest of the house.

                <img src="images/creativity/island/Kitchen Island4.jpeg" alt="Island Seating">
                <p>
                    With the new height of the island it was much easier to find stools that fit and allowed us to enjoy a quick meal or entertain 
                    company. In the time since remodeling the kitchen we have entertained on multiple holidays. The large amount of space on the 
                    island now gives my wife the freedom to make her famous charcuterie boards as overflowing as possible.

                    With our house decorated for Christmas the changes everywhere are very evident, but the new island is still my favorite and 
                    proudest accomplishment. To go along with the mid-century style we replaced the lights above the island with two simple hanging 
                    globes. These also match the new chandelier that was installed in the dining room. The wine cooler has taken the space of the old 
                    and has freed up much more room in our out-dated fridge (the next appliance to go). Overall this remodel taught me a lot about 
                    myself and my ability to learn new things and boosted my self-confidence to new levels.
