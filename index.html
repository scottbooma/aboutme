            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Scott Booma. I grew up in Virginia, outside of our nation's capital. I studied at Clemson 
                University in South Carolina where I majored in Finance with a minor in Accounting. I fell in love with 
                the area so much that I decided to move back down here after I graduated in 2016. In Greenville I found 
                my first job with Ford Credit in their College Graduate Program. I have been here ever since 
                working my way through four separate positions in five years landing in the Dealer Credit Analyst role 
                where I find myself today. Outside of Ford Credit you can typically find me just that... outside. Whether that is 
                hiking to a beautiful waterfall with my wife, competing in a stand-up paddleboard race, hitting jumps on my mountain 
                bike, camping by the lake in my vintage VW Bus, skiing down icy slopes, or even just tending to my vegetable garden. 
                I find the great outdoors to be like therapy to me, someplace I can truly relax.

                My desire to be a software engineer stems from my love for growth and creation. I am always looking for pathways to 
                further my growth in my career and in my personal life. I have always felt a need to create in my life, whether it was 
                playing the saxophone as a child, making jewelry in college (bit of a free-spirit phase), or messing around in my 
                little woodshop here at home today. I have also always been the "computer guy" in the family, fixing issues with the 
                internet when they would arise (did you try turning it off and on again?). Even though what I have learned so far is 
                fairly minimal in grand scheme of programming, I am itching to learn more and start new projects. With this website project 
                I am reminded of how much I love to learn new things. I have found that when attempting new concepts, such as the 
                drop-down menu, where I run into hurdles along the way that can cause frustration, that the end result when it works 
                is well worth the journey.
