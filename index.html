            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Scott Booma. I am a graduate of Clemson University with a degree in Finance and Accounting.
                I have been working at Ford Credit for 5 years now, and currently in my fourth position with the company.
                As my first job out of college I started as a Customer Service Rep working in Loss Prevention and doing my best 
                to both help customers in during difficult times and minimize Ford Credit's losses on bad debts. After that I worked 
                my way up to the position of Dealer Service Analyst where I spent many days (and holidays) buying paper for qualified customers 
                and making strong relationships with the dealerships we serve. From there I took a bit of a detour from the traditional 
                career path and found myself as an Audit Specialist - Wholesale. I worked with our outside auditing team to help minimize 
                Ford Credit's wholesale floorplan risk by ensuring our collateral on dealership lots was all accounted for. In 2021 I 
                made my way to the coveted Dealer Credit Analyst position. Here I am able to really apply my finance and accounting 
                background by analyzing and reviewing dealership financials for risk issues and determining proper mitigating 
                actions once the risks have been identified.
            </p>
            <p>
                All the while during my journey here at Ford Credit I have experienced much personal growth as well. By starting 
                my job at Ford Credit in Greenville, SC I gained true independence for the first time by leaving my family in Virginia 
                and living alone. Since then I have found much love and joy through various new hobbies and people. I met the woman 
                I now get to call my wife. I purchased a vintage VW bus with her that we have taken on many camping adventures. 
                I have found a calling in the outdoors by taking up paddleboarding, mountainbiking, and skiing. Overall the last 5 years 
                my life has been like a winding country road where I am driving a beat up old bus. Every turn brings something new, and 
                while there may be some bumps along the way everything is met with a smile and optimism. I can't wait to see what the 
                next fork in the road brings my way.

                My desire to be a software engineer stems from my love for growth and creation. I am always looking for pathways to 
                further my growth in my career and in my personal life. I have always had a need to create in my life, whether it was 
                playing the saxophone as a child, making jewelry in college (bit of a free-spirit phase), or messing around in my 
                little woodshop here at home today. I have also always been the "computer guy" in the family, fixing issues with the 
                internet when they would arise (did you try turning it off and on again?). I feel that with the small amount of coding 
                I have learned so far through this program I have found a new path for my life.
